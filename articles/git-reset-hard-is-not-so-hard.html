<h1>git reset --hard isn't that hard</h1>
<p class="authoring-date">Written on 29 November 2019</p>
<p>Like the experienced git user that I am, I accidentally deleted some of my
code. I did this by running <code>git reset --hard HEAD^^</code>. I meant to only insert
one circumflex, but that key acts differently on windows than it does on linux.
Sadly I am already way too used to the linux behaviour, which only inserts one
circumflex after hitting the key twice.</p>

<p>After a short search on StackOverflow, I found out, that reset doesn't
actually drop a commit. Instead the branch will just stop tracking that
commit. Meaning that you can still access the commit, as long as you still
have the commit-hash or you can try finding it with </code>git reflog<code>.</p>

<p>After reading the man-page for <code>git reset</code> this also makes sense, since all
that <code>git reset</code> is doing, is to modify the index and optionally your working
tree.</p>

<p>However, this is even more interesting, when you are deleting a branch. A
branch is really nothing more than a chain of tracked commits. So even after
deleting a branch, you can still find the commits in the reflog. And simply
<code>git cherry-pick</code> whatever you need.</p>
