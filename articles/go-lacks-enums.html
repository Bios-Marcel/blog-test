<h1>Go lacks enums</h1>
<p class="authoring-date">Written on 20 September 2020</p>
<p>As a Java programmer, I heavily make use of enums.
The reason is quite simple. Whenever I have a fixed set of values, i can easy
iterate over them and switch over them. The reason why I really like switching
over enums though, is that I am using an IDE that notifies me of every switch
that doesn't handle all possible values of an enum. Let's say I had the
following code:</p>

<code><pre>
public enum CarManufacturers {
  FIAT,
  FORD,
  MERCEDES,
  OPEN;
}

void someFunction(CarManufacturer manufacturer) {
  switch (manufacturer) {
    case FIAT:
      //SOMETHING
  }
}
</pre></code>

<p>I would get an error stating that a switchcase I had wasn't handling all
possible values and doesn't have a <code>default</code> case either. For those
who don't know, the <code>default</code> case is basically a catch-all case
for that can be used as a last resort. While switch-cases over enums are
technically not exhaustive in Java, probably because of being able to
technically extend an enum via reflection, the IDE still treats it that way.
If you extend an enum at runtime you deserve to burn either way.</p>

<p>So, the value that this provides to me, is that I can extend an enum and be
notified of all code pieces that need work.</p>

<p>Now let's look at Golang. In Go we don't have enums. The idiomatic go way for
such things appear to be type aliases and the <code>iota</code> keyword.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<code><pre>
type CarManufacturer int

const (
    Fiat = iota
    Ford
    Mercedes
    Opel
)

var Gotcha CarManufacturer = 5

func someFunction(x CarManufacturer) {
    switch x {
    case Fiat:
    case Ford:
    case Mercedes:
    case Opel:
    }
}
</pre></code>

<p>This creates the constants <code>Fiat</code> to <code>Opel</code>, incrementing
their value by one starting from <code>0</code>. However, as you can see, I can
manually create another value with the same type. The problem is, that anyone can
basically do this. So you never know whether you get some weird and unexpected
values at runtime. While you can still handle those with a <code>default</code>
case, my problem here really is the lack of static analysis and warnings. As the
compiler basically can't know whether you've handled all cases.</p>
