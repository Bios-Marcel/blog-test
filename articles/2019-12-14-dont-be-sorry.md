title: Don't be sorry
---

Something I have noticed in the open source community and also in myself
specifically, is that people feel guilty for things they don't do. You haven't
answered to that issue created a week ago, just because you didn't feel like
it? You forgot fixing that terrible bug in that library you started making for
fun, but others started relying on? You don't feel like keeping to work on a
certain thing anymore or heavily slow down the pace? Don't feel sorry! You are
doing all of this in your free time. YOUR free time.

Users of software, whether it's end-user applications, libraries or whatever,
will always have expectations. However, YOU don't have to meet these. You
haven't signed a contract, you haven't taken any money and you probably
haven't promised anyone anything.
