title: What do I think about Go
---

I have been doing Go for a while now and so far I have enjoyed it. Why do I
enjoy it though? First, let's look at my past!

I have been doing Java for three years now and I can't say that I am happy
with it any more. In the beginning I really liked Java, but over time that
has changed.

Here is a list of stuff that annoys me:

* Long start-up times
* You actually need to have Java on your machine (or ship a JVM)
* The JVM nags on your ram
* `NullPointerException`s everywhere
* It's verbose
* For every primitive an object type exists
* more...

The next language I looked at was Kotlin. Oh boy, Kotlin is so fun! It has
tons of cool features. After a while I stopped using Kotlin as well though,
since it still runs on the JVM and has it's own problems.

I still keep an eye on
[Kotlin native](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin-native/) though.

Then someone kept shilling Go. After a while, I thought I should just give
it a look. When I started getting into Go, I have noticed a few things that
I really liked. It was very easy to get started. There is an interactive
online tutorial that teaches you the basics and afterwards you just download
Go and get started. You don't have to get a build-tool, you don't have to get a
dependency manager and you don't have to get a test framework or something like
that. Go comes with all those tools built-in, which is what makes it really fun
and easy to get started.

Besides having all those tools built-in, it is also super easy to learn the
language itself, since it doesn't really have many features and a rather
simple syntax. You don't even have to think about formatting and such, as you
won't even be able to compile if the compiler doesn't like the way your code
is formatted.

Overall the language has a nice ecosystem, including it's community, just like
in Java, you'll almost always find an answer to your questions.

I don't think I like Go because it is such a revolutionary and good language.
I think I just like it because it is so easy to get started without any
frustration whatsoever.

However, I am not saying that Go is perfect, just like Java and Kotlin, Go has
it's own problems.

Here are some things I dislike about Go so far:

* `nil`, which means there are also `nil` dereferencing errors
* No generics (Those would be super handy)
* No really good IDE yet (VS Code / Goland come closest to an okay experience)

But who knows, maybe I'll start disliking Go as soon as I start any bigger
projects, which means that I'll probably face bigger problems.
