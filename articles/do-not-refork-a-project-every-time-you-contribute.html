<h1>Don't refork a GitHub repository every time you want to contribute</h1>
<p class="authoring-date">Written on 14 July 2019</p>
<p>Sometimes people contribute to one of my
projects, and every time that they want to contribute, they delete
their fork and fork the project again.</p>

<p>They usually do this because they don't know how to easily get an up-to-date
master branch again. Since it's much easier to just hit "delete" and "fork"
again, that's what they do instead.</p>

<p>However, this problem usually occurs when people start working on the `master`
branch instead of a branch specifically made for their PR.</p>

<p>So the next time you want to work on a fork of some project with the intent to
contribute your changes via a PR, do the following instead:</p>

<code><pre>
# Clone your fork
git clone git@github.com:/you/project
# Add the original repository as a new remote
git remote add original https://github.com/someone/project
# Now you'll have the remotes "origin" (fork) and "original" (original)
# We assume that your current master branch has no exclusive changes
# Now update your master using the originals masters state
git pull original master
# Now that you have an up-to-date master, create a new branch of that
git checkout -b your_new_feature
# This creates a new branch called `your_new_feature` and checks it out
# Now start implementing your feature and commit the changes.
# When you are done, push your changes to the fork
git push --all origin
# --all will push all branches to the remote
# Now create your PR via GitHub. As soon as it gets accepted into
# master, you can repeat the same procedure starting at
# `git pull original master`
</pre></code>

<p>This way you won't have to worry about both remotes having different
commits, merge commits or whatever, since all your changes happen on a
throwaway branch anyway.</p>

<p>In case you already have a poluted <code>master</code> branch, you
can do the following:</p>

<code><pre>
# Check the originals master out
git checkout original/master
# This will bring you into a "Detached HEAD" state, meaning you aren't on a
# branch, but on a specific commit you could say.
# Now delete master locally
git branch -D master
# After deleting master, we use our current state to recreate it
git checkout -b master
# Now we'll locally have an up-to-date master
# Now we push, but we need to apply `--force`, since our commit will delete commits that already exist upstream.
git push --force
</pre></code>

<p>I hope this helps ;)</p>
